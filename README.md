Hello ya! 

🚗🚗🚗
It is my own little website about cars with travel culture. 
I am looking forward to sharing with you what car culture is like from the perspective of Chinese friends. 
I would be more inclined to travel, but I would also cover the various car-related elements that we have access to in the post-00s for interpretation.

Happy that if you could give me some better advice or help with the bugs.
This is my first project, even though I'm 19s boy who  not even learned anything when middle-school. 
I expect progress. So young, to public my idea which is regarded as one of my treasures.

And at the same time I am also making vedios as development logs on bilibili.
Just search for '80S_squareBox' in bilibili that you will find me.

let's get the crazydream.
